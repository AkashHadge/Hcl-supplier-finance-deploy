    <h1 class="main-heading">What is Supplier Finance?</h1>
    <p>
      Supplier finance (or ‘supply chain finance’) is a type of cash advance.
      It’s a way for smaller businesses to benefit from the higher credit scores
      of their buyers, and for buyers to lengthen their payment terms. That
      might sound confusing, here’s how it works.
    </p>
    <div class="sub-block">
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        Large multinational companies are highly likely to honour invoices from
        suppliers. That means the suppliers that work with them can get 100% of
        the value advanced from a lender, minus a small fee, once the buyer has
        approved the invoice for payment because at this stage, the risk of
        non-payment is very low.
      </p>
      <h3>A breakdown of supplier finance funding</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The supplier issues an invoice to the buyer.</li>
        <li>
          The buyer confirms to the SHS Bank (lender) that the invoice has been
          approved for payment.
        </li>
        <li>The supplier gets the value straight away (minus a small fee).</li>
        <li>When payment is due, the buyer pays the SHS Bank (lender).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this way, the supplier's cash flow is stabilised because they get
        paid within a few days, rather than waiting for the standard ‘payment
        due’ date (which could be as long as 120 days). Meanwhile, the buyer
        simultaneously benefits, because they have effectively extended their
        payment terms, but without negatively impacting their suppliers. This is
        because the payment delay is taken on by the SHS Bank — so the supplier
        gets paid within a few days, but the buyer’s working capital is
        untouched until their extended payment terms are over.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Benefits of Supplier Finance</h2>
    <p>
      Supplier Finance is mutually beneficial for both buyers and suppliers,
      because it helps both parties stabilise their cash flow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Suppliers get paid within a few days rather than waiting for long
        payment terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because supply chain funding is directly based on the buyer’s credit
        rating, the cost can be lower too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buyers can extend their payment terms, i.e. delay paying suppliers for
        longer than normal, but without putting pressure on their suppliers
        directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s the SHS Bank (lender) whose working capital is affected — leaving
        both the buyer’s and supplier’s working capital free to use for other
        business purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Supply Finance is a collaborative process. The SHS Bank helps both the
      buyer and the supplier, and all three parties have an arrangement
      together.
